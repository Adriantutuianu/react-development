/*
Events are things or actions that occur in your system.
You need your system to respond to the events in a specific way.
Events in React JS are like the events in Javascript! The only difference is their syntax.
Yes, React JS offers a more simple and elegant syntax!
Different types of event bindings are provided.
The event handlers help in determining what actions should be taken when the event gets fired.
The events can be a normal mouse click, key press, window resize or a change in the text input.
As a response to an event, show an alert box to the user.
The responses can be navigation to another window, the change in the display or occurrence of the new screen or images.
